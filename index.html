        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, 
            values, morals, beliefs, habits and personal development. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, 
            discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, 
            learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings, 
            and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. 
            The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills 
            deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. 
            Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. 
            As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, 
            formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.
            Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
            Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher 
            learning in Europe.[3] The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the 
            intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. 
            European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.

            The Renaissance in Europe ushered in a new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry and appreciation of ancient Greek 
            and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to 
            spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences 
            spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations â€“ as with the 
            Jesuit China missions who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between China and 
            Europe, translating works from Europe like Euclid's Elements for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of Confucius for European 
            audiences. The Enlightenment saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe. Much of modern traditional 
            Western and Eastern education is based on the Prussian education system.
